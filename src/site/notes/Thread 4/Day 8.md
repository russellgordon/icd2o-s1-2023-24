	- This is your third working period to implement the plans you have made with your partner(s) at Lakefield DPS.

	> If you are not caught up on making entries in your portfolio to document your progress and process to this point, please stop what you are doing and make those entries now. A gentle reminder [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S1)#Evaluation Checklist\|the final product only counts for 25% of your grade]] on this task.
