### Thread 4, Day 5 - Monday, April 29, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S1)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- This is your first working period to begin implementing  the plans you have made with your partner(s) at Lakefield DPS.
	- You are welcome to use Alice, [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu), or whatever programming environment you are comfortable with and that best fits the task at hand.
	- Mr. Gordon will lead a few mini-demos for interested students that are choosing to work with [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com), on:
		- importing [images](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/Food_Images.zip)
		- using a Google Sheet as a data source
		- adding 2D motion using the Canvas block, so that you can work with stages and sprites
		- taking and checking input
	- Here are some good sources for image and audio assets:
		- [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl)
		- [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-2d)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Please keep track of the source(s) from where you obtain image and audio assets for your game. These should be cited within your game – for example – on a "Credits" screen.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make progress on implementation of your app idea.
	- Be certain to briefly share an update [on Notion](https://notion.so), including screenshot(s) and a link to the current state of your project (if using Thunkable) or the **.a3p** file (if using Alice).
