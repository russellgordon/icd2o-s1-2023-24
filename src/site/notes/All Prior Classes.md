### Thread 1, Day 1 - Monday, September 11, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Activity: Ultimate Rock-Paper-Scissors
	- Starting with 16 people, after just four rounds, we found a champion.
	- The speed with which one member of our class was found to be the ultimate Rock-Paper-Scissors champion is similar to the efficiency of the [binary search algorithm](https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/BinarySearchNew.html).
		- An *algorithm* is nothing more than a series of steps taken to accomplish a goal.
		- Worst case, using binary search with a sorted list of 16 numbers, a target number can be found with 4 comparisons. 
1. Course Outline
	- Using the think-pair-share protocol to review and ask clarifying questions about the structure of this course.
1. Required Course Materials
	- Hardcover notebooks with graph paper, and copies of [A Pocket Guide to Debugging](https://store.wizardzines.com/products/the-pocket-guide-to-debugging) were distributed.
	- Costs will be billed back to your family's account.
	> [!NOTE]
	> If you missed today's class, see Mr. Gordon to obtain these required course materials.
1. Tutorial: Installing Google Drive for Desktop
	- Learn how to synchronize files between cloud storage in Google Drive and your local computer's storage.
1. Activity: Tying Shoelaces
	- Computers take instructions very literally.
	- There are two kinds of errors: *syntax* and *logical*.
		- A syntax error is when the computer does not understand an instruction.
		- A logical error is when the computer understands and carries out an instruction, but the result is not what the programmer intended.
