### Thread 4, Day 5 - Monday, April 29, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S1)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- This is your first working period to begin implementing  the plans you have made with your partner(s) at Lakefield DPS.
	- You are welcome to use Alice, [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu), or whatever programming environment you are comfortable with and that best fits the task at hand.
	- Mr. Gordon will lead a few mini-demos for interested students that are choosing to work with [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com), on:
		- importing [images](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/Food_Images.zip)
		- using a Google Sheet as a data source
		- adding 2D motion using the Canvas block, so that you can work with stages and sprites
		- taking and checking input
	- Here are some good sources for image and audio assets:
		- [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl)
		- [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-2d)

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Please keep track of the source(s) from where you obtain image and audio assets for your game. These should be cited within your game – for example – on a "Credits" screen.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make progress on implementation of your app idea.
	- Be certain to briefly share an update [on Notion](https://notion.so), including screenshot(s) and a link to the current state of your project (if using Thunkable) or the **.a3p** file (if using Alice).

### Thread 3, Day 6 - Thursday, February 15, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Concept: [[Concepts/Sharing Character Abilities with Other Students\|Sharing Character Abilities with Other Students]]
	- What is the difference between a class and an object?
	- How can we share a procedure written for a class in one world for use in another Alice world?
1. Task: [[Tasks/Authoring Class-Level Procedures\|Authoring Class-Level Procedures]]
	- Together, we will think of [at least 20 useful actions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4RTPdkINbwOknkLEYOYhc0A2j7c9NwPH0AqRuzp_WEnZq1w/viewform), for any combination of these classes in Alice:
		- **Biped**
		- **Flyer**
		- **Prop**
		- **Quadruped**
		- **Slitherer**
		- **Swimmer**
		- **Transport**
		> [!NOTE]
		> 
		> Each student must [submit at least two ideas](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4RTPdkINbwOknkLEYOYhc0A2j7c9NwPH0AqRuzp_WEnZq1w/viewform), without repeats.
		> 
		> The list of submitted actions will be on the TV screen at the front of the class.
	- Then, students will decide upon what actions they want to program for their [[Tasks/Authoring Class-Level Procedures\|mid-module task]].
	> [!TIP]
	> 
	> The procedures you implement *do not* have to be one of the procedure ideas you came up with and submitted to the form.
	- You have the rest of the period to make further progress with your [[Tasks/Authoring Class-Level Procedures\|mid-module task]].
	- Your goal should be to complete at *least* one procedure by our next class.
	> [!NOTE]
	> Here is [the list of procedures and what each student has agreed to work on](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uw5e0pxyFXWhOGLDuGzqFVNYreRS9tJFlQb3ihwxEH4/edit?resourcekey#gid=386892402).
	
###### Things to do before our next class

- [ ] Make clear progress your [[Tasks/Authoring Class-Level Procedures\|mid-module task]] by completing at least one procedure and documenting it in a post [on Notion](https://notion.so).

	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! 🦆
2. Activity: [[Activities/Ramones, Revisited\|Ramones, Revisited]]
	- Finish the job on the Ramones poster by considering sequence, iteration, and making a careful plan.
