### Thread 2, Day 10 - Wednesday, December 6, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Discussion: [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Solving logical errors and syntax errors can be frustrating, but everyone deals with it, even experienced programmers. 
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! ðŸ¦†
2. Activity: [[Activities/Ramones, Revisited\|Ramones, Revisited]]
	- Finish the job on the Ramones poster by considering sequence, iteration, and making a careful plan.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make a portfolio post [on Notion](https://notion.so), share your progress, and summarize what you've learned today about abstraction.
