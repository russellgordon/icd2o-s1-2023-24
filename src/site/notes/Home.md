### Thread 4, Day 8 - Tuesday, May 7, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S1)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- This is your third working period to implement the plans you have made with your partner(s) at Lakefield DPS.
	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> 
	> If you are not caught up on making entries in your portfolio to document your progress and process to this point, please stop what you are doing and make those entries now. A gentle reminder [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S1)#Evaluation Checklist\|the final product only counts for 25% of your grade]] on this task.
	- Mr. Gordon has recorded two more short videos to explain canvas and sprite-related concepts in Thunkable:
		- [Bouncing and Shooting](https://youtu.be/fKKDUB1VNS0)
			- You can clone this [bouncing experiments project](https://x.thunkable.com/copy/000eadc6331828dba81ce70da3d9a4ce) to follow along and then try the super-short mini-challenges that are described.
		- [Gravity and Collisions](https://youtu.be/-sDupZFBQMw)
			- You can clone this [gravity experiments project](https://x.thunkable.com/copy/57c12ba50d1adfef892caedf9da9f254) to follow along and then try the super-short mini-challenges that are described.
	- Continue making progress on implementing functionality in your app prior to our final visit to LDPS this Friday at 8:30 AM, when the final version of your app will be delivered to your partners.
	- Be sure to consult [[All Prior Classes\|All Prior Classes]] to access prior resources shared to help you build out your apps.
		
###### Things to do before our next class

	- Be certain to briefly share an update [on Notion](https://notion.so), including screenshot(s) and a link to the current state of your project (if using Thunkable) or the **.a3p** file (if using Alice).
