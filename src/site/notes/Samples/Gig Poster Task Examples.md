# Gig Poster Task Exemplars

This is an example of a long-running task at the grade 10 level in the Computer Studies program.

Several pieces of student work at varying levels of achievement are provided.

## Task

Here is the [[Tasks/Custom Gig Poster\|task as provided to students]] and [a complete teacher-authored exemplar](https://lakefieldcs.notion.site/868d23e3bf67415b92f37f61086d6d3f?v=3ab707db12414dd68a511df18241f84c) that meets expectations.

## Student Work

### Significantly Exceeds Expectations

Here is the [portfolio of a student](https://lakefieldcs.notion.site/a1783c7fa9e64ed08732bbf93552d683?v=b45ad012f80a495a84c84649b9370564&pvs=4) whose process and product significantly exceeds expectations. They were committed to continuous improvement based on feedback – they applied the design cycle. They were also careful to produce evidence of meeting all success criteria – without having to be reminded of those criteria by the teacher.

### Exceeds Expectations

Here is the [portfolio of a student](https://lakefieldcs.notion.site/33dddbb258d74c0ca006e48c4bc242a4?v=dd1c528c807245d3978d4e6089a05f47&pvs=4) whose process and product exceeds expectations. Their planning process was not ideal, however, and they omitted a demonstration of a key concept (selection statements).

### Meets Expectations

Here is the [portfolio of a student](https://lakefieldcs.notion.site/1f0697a1ff984bdc846f9fd715635945?v=48765e695af543ce9df0e059a3555812&pvs=4) whose process and product largely meets expectations. This student was reluctant to continue working on their product once they had something that they felt met expectations; with encouragement, they continued to make some modest additional changes based on feedback.

### Mostly Meets Expectations

Here is the [portfolio of a student](https://lakefieldcs.notion.site/22008b29d951493981e520236432be8d?v=457ad3aefdbf46e981e2b3297675ff2d&pvs=4) whose process and product mostly meets expectations, but whom required significant guidance and support to do so.
